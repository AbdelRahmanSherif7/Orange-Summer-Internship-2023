During my **Orange Telecom summer internship**, I gained hands-on experience in the **E-Payments business process** and **IT department workflow**. I monitored and analyzed the **full cycle of e-payment transactions**, including **campaign solutions**, and explored key differences between **E-Top Up services and payment gateways**, enhancing my technical understanding. As part of my tasks, I developed a **log analysis and transaction monitoring system** using Python to parse large log files, extract timestamps, and track **successful API transactions per minute**, identifying peak transaction hours for performance analysis. Additionally, I implemented **data visualization using Matplotlib**, creating real-time graphs to monitor transaction trends and provide insights into peak operational periods and system performance.
